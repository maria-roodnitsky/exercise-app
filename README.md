# exercise-app
An Android application with standard exercise application functionality. 

This application allows a user to create and save a profile and log and track physical activity. 

There is a manual entry mode where users simply enter their data (which can then be converted between metric and imperial units) and an automatic entry mode where user location is tracked using the Google Maps API and their activity is determined using the Google Activity Recognition API. 

All UI design is Dartmouth centric, seeing as the developers, Sudharsan and Maria were Dartmouth students at the time of development. Maria's contributions were made using her student github account (f003kgm).
